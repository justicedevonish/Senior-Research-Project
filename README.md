## Primary Objective

##### Determine which fractal patterns are best to predict the stock market by using their financial performance metrics and their correlating stock indicators. 




##### Methodology
---
1. Gather historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance 
2. Employ fractal techniques to identify self-similar patterns within the stock price data
3. Develop algorithms to automatically detect patterns
4. Evaluate performance of algorithms using financial performance metrics
5. Conduct backtesting to assess algorithms prediction on the stock market
6. Determine which fractal pattern indicator is best
